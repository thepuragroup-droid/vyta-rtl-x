/**
 * Storefront promotions, resolved once for the whole app.
 *
 * Three offers run on the storefront and they need the same facts — the
 * admin's promo settings, who this visitor is, and what is in their cart:
 *
 *   • free shipping past a spend threshold (`FreeShippingToast`, the cart and
 *     checkout progress bars);
 *   • the paid-ads welcome discount (`AdDiscountBanner`, the cart and checkout
 *     totals, and the hand-off itself) — for ad visitors, on their first order
 *     only;
 *   • the limited-time cart offer (the cart's offer strip and both checkout
 *     totals) — for any cart carrying enough items, while the offer runs.
 *
 * Resolving them here rather than in each component means one settings fetch
 * per app load instead of one per screen, and one definition of "eligible" that
 * the nav strip, the cart and the checkout cannot drift apart on.
 *
 * NONE of this is trusted for money. `/api/checkout/puramass` re-reads the
 * settings, re-reads the attribution cookies and re-prices the cart from the
 * catalog before it discounts anything — what happens here only decides what
 * the buyer is told.
