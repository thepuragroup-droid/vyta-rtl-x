-- Invoice email — sending, templates, CC list, history
-- =============================================================================
-- Extends site_settings with invoice-email template fields and a separate
-- BCC list ("invoice copies"). Adds last-emailed tracking columns on invoices
-- and a per-send invoice_email_log table.
