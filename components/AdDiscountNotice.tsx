/**
 * The paid-ads welcome offer, inline in the nav's research-disclaimer row.
 *
 * Shown only to visitors who arrived on an ad — everyone else sees the site
 * unchanged, because the offer is what that click paid for. A guest is invited
 * to create an account; once they have one the same line turns into
 * confirmation that the discount is on their order, so the promise made at the
 * top of the funnel is still visible at the bottom of it.
 *
 * It is a welcome offer, so a signed-in customer only sees it while it is
 * actually theirs: once they have ordered it disappears, rather than inviting
 * them to claim a discount the checkout would refuse. A signed-in customer is
 * never shown the guest "sign up and save" call to action.
 *
 * ## Why this is a fragment and not a strip
 *
 * It used to be its own full-width row under the disclaimer, and that made the
 * fixed nav taller, which the storefront screens — each carrying its own
 * literal top padding — had to be compensated for with a body-padding rule,
 * and that gap showed above the hero as a second bar.
 *
 * Sitting inside the disclaimer row instead, it inherits that row's background
 * and colours and adds no height at all. So it renders no wrapper, no
 * background and no spacing of its own: just a separator and the offer, as
 * siblings of "Research Only".
 *
 * Nothing here decides money. `/api/checkout/puramass` re-reads the attribution
 * cookies, the customer row and their order history, and applies the discount
 * itself (lib/promos/ad-discount.ts); this only says what is about to happen.
