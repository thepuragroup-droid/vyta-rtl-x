/**
 * Middleware runs on every storefront request and is the only place that sees
 * a visitor's very first landing URL — by the time React hydrates, a
 * client-side navigation may already have replaced it. It does three things:
 *
 *   1. mints the anonymous visitor + session ids the activity log is keyed by;
 *   2. records the first and last marketing touch (Google Ads gclid, Meta
 *      fbclid, UTM tagging, referring host) as cookies;
 *   3. keeps the existing affiliate `?ref=` capture.
 *
 * Only `?ref=` is stripped from the URL. `gclid` and friends are deliberately
 * left in place: Google's own conversion linker and GA4 auto-tagging read them
 * from the address bar, and removing them breaks Ads reporting — the thing
 * this is meant to support.
 *
 * Note on consent: these cookies are set on arrival, before the banner is
 * answered, exactly as the pre-existing `ref_code` cookie already was. What
 * consent gates is persistence — nothing is written to the database until
 * `isTrackingAllowed` in lib/analytics/attribution-server.ts says so.
