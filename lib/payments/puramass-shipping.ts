/**
 * Shipping for the PuraMass (Stealth Health) hosted checkout.
 *
 * PuraMass now accepts a `shipping_total_cents` on the order it creates, so the
 * shipping the buyer pays is ours to decide instead of a flat fee we could only
 * guess at. This module holds the rules for deciding it:
 *
 *   • which couriers a buyer may choose from (UPS / FedEx / Canada Post),
 *   • which of the returned services are worth showing (the fastest handful),
 *   • what each one costs once the admin's processing fee is folded in,
 *   • the flat fallback used when live rates are switched off or the quote
 *     comes back empty,
 *   • and how far a cart is toward the free-shipping threshold.
 *
 * Everything here is pure so the ranking can be unit-tested — and so the
 * checkout screen can import the same constants and types without dragging the
 * server-only Easyship client into the browser bundle. The Easyship call itself
 * lives in lib/easyship.ts and the quote endpoint in
 * app/api/checkout/puramass/rates.
 *
 * The processing fee is the SAME site setting the storefront's own shipping
 * uses (`shipping_handling_fee_type` / `shipping_handling_fee_value`, surfaced
 * in Site Settings as "Processing fee"). It defaults to zero, is folded into
 * the quoted price, and is never itemised for the buyer.
