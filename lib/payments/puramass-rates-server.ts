/**
 * The one place a hosted-checkout shipping quote is produced.
 *
 * Two callers need it and they must never disagree: the rates endpoint the
 * checkout screen polls while the buyer types their address, and the hand-off
 * route that re-quotes at submit time to price the option they picked. If those
 * built their Easyship request differently — a different parcel weight, a
 * different origin, a different fee — the buyer would be shown one price and
 * charged another. So both go through here.
 *
 * SERVER-ONLY: reads the Easyship API key out of site settings. The pure rules
 * it applies (courier whitelist, ranking, the processing fee, the flat
 * fallback) live in lib/payments/puramass-shipping.ts, which the browser may
 * import.
 *
 * Never throws and always returns at least one option. A courier lookup is not
 * allowed to be the thing that stops someone buying, so every failure — the
 * feature switched off, Easyship unconfigured, the API down, no services for
 * the destination — resolves to the flat rate instead of an error.
