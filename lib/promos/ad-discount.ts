/**
 * The paid-ads welcome discount.
 *
 * Someone who arrived on a Google / Meta / Bing / TikTok / LinkedIn ad and then
 * created an account gets a percentage off the goods subtotal of their FIRST
 * hosted checkout. The offer is advertised on a strip under the nav bar,
 * restated on the cart and checkout screens, and settled server-side at
 * hand-off. It is a welcome offer: it applies once, to the first order, and
 * only to visitors that a paid ad actually won.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and isomorphic: the storefront imports it to draw the
 * offer, and `/api/checkout/puramass` imports the same functions to decide the
 * money. Neither touches `window`, `next/server` or Supabase, so the two can
 * never drift into disagreeing about who qualifies or for how much.
 *
 * ## Why the discount is distributed over the line prices
 *
 * The PuraMass hosted order has no discount field. It has `unit_price_cents`
 * per line, and that is the only lever we have — so the discount is taken off
 * the lines themselves before the payload is sent, and the hosted page charges
 * the already-discounted amounts. `distributeAdDiscount` does that split.
 *
 * Per-unit integer prices cannot always land on an exact percentage (a line of
 * 3 units can only move in 3-cent steps), so the split is rounded in the
 * BUYER's favour: the discount actually taken is never less than the
 * advertised percentage of the subtotal, and never more than a cent per line
 * above it.
 *
 * ## The zero-price boundary
 *
 * One thing the partner API cannot express: a line at zero. `unit_price_cents`
 * is optional there, so `buildPuramassOrderBody` omits a zero and PuraMass then
 * charges its OWN catalog price — meaning "free" would arrive as "full list".
 * The functions here happily return a zero (100% off really is zero), but the
 * caller must refuse to send a split that produced one, and the admin settings
 * route caps the percentage at 99 so it cannot be reached by configuration.

 * Take `percent` off the subtotal by lowering each line's unit price.

 * The hosted order charges `unit_price_cents × quantity` per line, so the only

 * that falls between two of them is not payable. The split therefore:
 *
 *   1. floors every unit price at its exact discounted value, which can only
 *      overshoot (takes off at least the target), then
 *   2. hands whole cents back, largest fractional remainder first, while a
 *      line's `quantity` cents still fit under the target.
 *
 * The result is the closest payable total at or below the target, so the buyer
 * is never charged more than the offer promised. `discountCents` reports what
 * was really taken rather than what was asked for, and is what gets recorded
 * against the order.
 *
 * A line is never marked up: step 2 will not push a unit price back above its
 * list price even if other lines in the same order absorbed more of the split.
 *
 * A returned price of zero is arithmetically right but not sendable — see the
 * zero-price boundary at the top of this file. Callers check for it.
