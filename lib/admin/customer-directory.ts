 *   2. **PuraMass buyers** — people who only ever bought through the PuraMass
 *      (Stealth Health) hosted checkout and never registered here. All we know
 *      about them is what the partner reported on the order payload: name,
 *      email, phone, and a shipping address. There is no account, no login, no
 *      currency preference, no activity trail.
 *
 * The two are deliberately NOT normalised into one shape and pretended to be
 * equivalent — the UI leans on `source` to draw a hard visual line, and every
 * field a PuraMass buyer can't have is explicitly `null` rather than faked.
 *
 * SERVER ONLY: `puramass_orders` is service-role-locked, so everything here
 * runs behind an admin-gated route with the service key.
